    <h1>Skiing has a home.</h1> <!-- first title under picture -->
    
    <p>Skiing wasn't always so <em>cool</em>. Two planker, froot booter, and sled dogger are some of the <em>clean</em> names you would hear from snowboarders on the chairlift overhead as you ride through the park. That's what it was like when Newschoolers.com started but skiing has changed in many ways since. Now the most watched event at the <strong>X-games</strong> and making its debut at the <strong>Winter Olympics</strong>, skiing is finaly <em>cool</em>.</p>
